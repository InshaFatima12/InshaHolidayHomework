<h1>Social Science Holiday Homework- </h1> <br>
Out of the various things that give you
happiness, travelling must be at the top of
your list. However, in these extraordinary
times when travelling is restricted, you can
explore some lesser known places in India
online and create a virtual tour on any one.
The virtual tour video should be between 2-3
minutes. You have to give your voice-over
explaining the tour.
