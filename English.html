 The wonders in Oman!
<br>
<br>
It was a very exciting day, we were going to Oman to visit my aunt. We all rushed as we did not want to miss a single second of this fun-filled day, little did we know what the day had in store for us. We booked a cab and were set on our way to the airport. After hours of driving, we finally checked in and started boarding the plane. Although it wasn’t my first time going to Oman, I was still elated. The airplane gradually started ascending, I gazed out my window as the buildings got smaller and smaller! It was a fun flight, I fell asleep quite early. Soon I woke up to my mother telling me to look at the beautiful view outside. I could see the ocean and small hills, it seemed magical and unreal! At last, we landed and my aunt was there to pick us up. We decided to go home, freshen up, and then set out on our journey on the beaches. On our way, I saw a rock which was sculpted into a lion’s face! We passed a lot of beaches and resorts and reached home. It was amazing to notice that there were beaches within walking distance from the house! I quickly freshened up and started bugging my dad to take me out to the beach to collect shells. He agreed and we went out to the beach, there I played with the water, collected some shells and even saw a crab and its babies crawling into the damp sand! It started getting late, we headed home as my aunt and mother were calling us to eat the delicious meal they put together. This was the end of our wondrous day, more experiences were yet to be stated.
