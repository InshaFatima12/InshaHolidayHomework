<h1>Science Holiday Homework- </h1> <br>
We all remember playing with Yo-Yo, LEGO, spinning top, toy cars, musical piano and what not in our
childhood days. Toys bring happiness and joy in our lives. They can help develop problem solving skills,
teach about conflict resolution and how cause and effect works. Let’s revisit our childhood days and
challenge ourselves to make creative, meaningful and joyful toys using the principles of science.
<br>
Make any two such toys by using waste materials available at home.
